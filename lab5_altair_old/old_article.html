<h1>An Analysis of Election Polls</h1>
<body>

<p>
    The 2020 election cycle is shaping up to be one of the most exciting elections in recent history. Current President
    Donald Trump is a polarizing figure, but so are some of the candidates running for the Democratic nominee. In this
    article, we will examine three main findings from a FiveThirtyEight dataset that has voter favorability poll results
    for the 2020 general presidential election. The question presented to respondents was: "If Candidate X were the
    Democratic nominee, who would you vote for?" (Based on the assumption that President Trump will remain the
    Republican nominee.)


</p>

<h2>1. Do general election favorability ratings tend to follow primary elections?</h2>

<p>
    The primary election cycle has already started in a few states (e.g. Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada). We know the
    results of these primary elections is not an exact comparison to the general presidential election, since this data
    matches Democratic candidates against Trump, but it may inform us about whether or not support for a particular
    candidate might carry into the general election. For instance, we can look at people's
    polling preferences in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, compared to the known outcomes of the primaries/caucuses. We
    know that
    Iowa is still being disputed (but Buttigieg and Sanders are functionally tied for 1st place), Sanders won New
    Hampshire, but Pete Buttigieg (2nd place) was very close to his numbers. In Nevada, Bernie won by a
    much bigger percentage.
    Below is a chart that shows the number of times each Democratic candidate beat Trump in a poll, divided by the total
    number of polls that that candidate was listed in. Here, "beating Trump" is calculated by taking the difference
    between
    the % of people who said they would vote for Democratic candidate X and the % of people who said they would vote for
    Trump. If the difference was positive, this counted as a win.

    (Note: The 0% values for Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are true 0%'s - both of these candidates were asked
    about in multiple Iowa polls.)
</div>

<p>
    None of the candidates do very well in head-to-head matchups against Trump in Iowa. In Nevada and New Hampshire,
    Sanders beats Trump in about 80% of the polls. In national polling, Joe Biden is the candidate with the highest % of
    poll results that have him beating Trump. However, we see that in both New Hampshire and Nevada, Bernie Sanders was
    the candidate that had the highest % of polls that had him beating Trump in the general election. </p>

<h2>2. Do candidates' favorability change by polling method? </h2>

It might also be useful to look at candidate performance by polling methodology. We know that Bernie Sanders does
extremely well among young voters, who might be more likely to answer polls conducted online or via text. Biden, on the
other hand, performs well among older voters, who may be more likely to answer polls conducted over the phone. The chart
below shows the breakdown of candidates' favorability percentages by region and polling methodology.
<div>
    <div id="vis2"></div>
    <br/>
</div>

From the data, we see that for a given region, the Democratic candidates all seem to have similar trends by polling
methods. For instance, in the Midwest, Sanders, Warren, and Biden all do the worst in Automated Phone polls. In the
South, however, all of the candidates do the worst in Live Phone/Online polls.
This seems to indicate that regional differences may be a stronger factor in how a candidate performs in polls, rather
than polling methodology.

<h3>3. Where does Trump do extremely well in terms of voter preferences?
</h3>

We know that Donald Trump won several key swing states in the Midwest, like Ohio and Michigan. He also won many Southern
states, but didn't perform very well in states on the West Coast, or in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic regions of the US. It
would be useful to know if he can repeat his success in the Midwest and South in 2020. The chart below shows his average
favorability ratings over time, by pollster and state. In the chart, we can also compare different regions to national
trends.
